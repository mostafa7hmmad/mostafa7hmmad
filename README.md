## How to Make it Truly Interactive?

1. **Use GitHub Pages for Interactive Graphs**:
   - Build interactive graphs using JavaScript frameworks like **Chart.js** or **Plotly**.
   - Host these graphs using **GitHub Pages**.
   - Link them in your README like:
     ```markdown
     [View Interactive AI Graphs](https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/)
     ```

2. **GIFs or SVG Animations**:
   - Add animations to visualize processes (e.g., progress, AI predictions).
   - Host them in your repository and embed them in your README.

3. **Dynamic Tables**:
   - Generate tables of your project stats (e.g., stars, forks) automatically using GitHub Actions.
